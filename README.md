 ## A zombie survival game in the Minetest engine

---


### Build Mode

There is no editor gui yet, so you'll have to look through the registrations in the terrain mod to get tile names.

You can add this to your minetest.conf if you want to edit the map.

```build_mode = true```

Alternatively you can just type in this, go to the main menu, then go back into the game to go into build mode.

```/set -n build_mode true```

Tiles are a bit different than you're most likely used to. There are no ``mod:names_seperated_by_colon``.

When doing ``/giveme`` you can simply type in ``/giveme concrete`` for example.
