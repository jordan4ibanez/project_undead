 A zombie survival game in the Minetest engine


You can this to your minetest.conf if you want to edit the map. 

There is no editor gui yet, so you'll have to look through the registrations in the terrain mod to get tile names.

```build_mode = true```

Alternatively you can just type in this, go to the main menu, then go back into the game to go into build mode.

```/set -n build_mode true```
