 ## A zombie survival game in the Minetest engine

---


### Editor Mode

There is no editor gui yet, so you'll have to look through the registrations in the terrain mod to get tile names.

You can add this to your minetest.conf if you want to edit the map.

```editor_mode = true```

Alternatively you can just type in this, go to the main menu, then go back into the game to go into editor mode.

This is useful for content creators to customize the environment, along with making all new environments for players to
survive in.

```/set editor_mode true```

Tiles are a bit different than you're most likely used to. There are no ``mod:names_seperated_by_colon``.

When doing ``/giveme`` you can simply type in ``/giveme concrete`` for example.

### Climbing over things

If you come to an obstacle in the way, say a barrier, sand bag, guard rail, low fence, you could hold space and forwards
to climb over it. You can not climb over everything, so plan your getaway accordingly.
